# build

Hi build contributor! If you do any change in `scripts/master/` or touching any
master's `html/` directories, you must restart master.chromium.fyi first and
ensure that it still works before restarting other masters.

## Recipes

If you're here to make a change to 'recipes' (the code located in
`scripts/slave/recipes*`), please take a look at the
[README](./scripts/slave/README.md) for more information pertaining to recipes.
