  This object, when used as a Builder's 'nextSlave' function, allows a strata-
  based preferential treatment to be assigned to a Builder's Slaves.

  The 'nextSlave' function is called on a scheduled build when an associated
  slave becomes available, either coming online or finishing an existing build.
  These events are used as stimulus to enable the primary builder(s) to pick
  up builds when appropriate.

  1) If a Primary is available, the build will be assigned to them.
  2) If a Primary builder is busy or is still within its grace period for
    unavailability, no slave will be assigned in anticipation of the
    'nextSlave' being re-invoked once the builder returns (1). If the grace
    period expires, we "poke" the master to call 'nextSlave', at which point
    the build will fall through to a lower strata.
  3) If a Primary slave is offline past its grace period, the build will be
    assigned to a Floating slave.

  Args:
    fs (FloatingSet): The set of available primary/floating slaves.
    grace_period: (timedelta) The amount of time that a slave can be offline
        before builds fall through to a lower strata.

      assignment (slave_builders).
    - The total set of ONLINE 'SlaveBuilder' instances associated with
      'builder' (builder.slaves)
    - The set of all slaves configured for Builder (via
      '_get_all_slave_status')

    We compile that into a stateful awareness and use it as a decision point.
    Based on the slave availability and grace period, we will either:
    (1) Return a slave immediately to claim this build. We do this if:
      (1a) There was a "primary" build slave available, or
      (1b) We are outside of all of the grace periods for the primary slaves,
           and there is a floating builder available.
    (2) Return 'None' (delaying the build) in anticipation of primary/floating
        availability.

    If we go with (2), we will schedule a 'poke' timer to stimulate a future
    'nextSlave' call, since BuildBot only checks for builds on explicit slave
    availability edges. This covers the case where floating builders are
    available, but aren't enlisted because we're within the grace period. In
    this case, we need to re-evaluate slaves after the grace period expires,
    but actual slave state won't haev changed, so no new slave availabilty edge
    will have occurred.
